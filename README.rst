Requirements
============

- Python >=3.10
- pip
- Pipenv
- Docker

Getting source code
===================

`Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ the
repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/vmware/repository-service-tuf-worker>`_ and
`clone <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`_
it to your local machine:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/repository-service-tuf-worker.git

Add a `remote
<https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork>`_ and
regularly `sync <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork>`_ to make sure
you stay up-to-date with our repository:

.. code-block:: console

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/vmware/repository-service-tuf-worker
    git checkout main
    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/main


Installing project requirements
===============================

This repository has the ``requirements.txt`` and the ``requirements-dev.txt``
files to help build your virtual environment.

We also recommend using `Pipenv <https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ to manage
your virtual environment.

.. code:: shell

  $ pip install pipenv
  $ pipenv shell


Install development requirements


.. code:: shell

  $ pipenv install -d


.. note::

    MacOS running on Macbooks M1

    For developers, after above command, run

    .. code:: shell

        $ pip uninstall cryptography cffi -y
        $ pip cache purge
        $ LDFLAGS=-L$(brew --prefix libffi)/lib CFLAGS=-I$(brew --prefix libffi)/include pip install cffi cryptography

Database migrations
===================

Changing database model requires to generate a database migrations with Alembic.

.. code:: shell

  $ make db-migration M="update message"


Running checks with pre-commit:
===============================

The pre-commit tool is installed as part of the development requirements.

To automatically run checks before you commit your changes you should run:

.. code:: shell

    $ make precommit

This will install the git hook scripts for the first time, it will update to the
latest versions of the hooks and run the pre-commit tool.
Now ``pre-commit`` will run automatically on ``git commit``.


Running the development Worker locally

  All code changes will reload the Worker container automatically.

.. code:: shell

  $ make run-dev


See Makefile for more options
